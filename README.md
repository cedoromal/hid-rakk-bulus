# HID Driver for Rakk Bulus
## Disclaimer
This project was tested and is initially known to work on **Linux Mint 22.1 x86_64** with **Kernel 6.8.0-60-generic**.

While it is possible to make this work on other distros and kernel versions, I cannot fully guarantee it.

### Distros and kernel versions tested and working:
- Linux Mint 22.1 x86_64 (6.8.0-60-generic)
- Linux Mint 22.1 x86_64 (6.8.0-62-generic)

## Installation
The following commands will build and install the driver:
```bash
make
sudo make install
```

## Removal
To remove the driver, use the following command:
```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

If the driver is already loaded, you might want to unload it using the following command:
```bash
sudo rmmod hid-rakk-bulus
```

## Cleanup
To cleanup the files generated by `make` in the project directory, use:
```
make clean
```
